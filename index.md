### Churn Prediction Engine

Churn is defined in business terms as ‘when a client cancels a subscription to a service they have been using.’ A common example is people cancelling Spotify/Netflix subscriptions. So, Churn Prediction is essentially predicting which clients are most likely to cancel a subscription i.e ‘leave a company’ based on their usage of the service.

From a company point of view, it is necessary to gain this information because acquiring new customers is often arduous and costlier than retaining old ones. Hence, the insights gained from Churn Prediction helps them to focus more on the customers that are at a high risk of leaving.
